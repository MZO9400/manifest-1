vbajs's modded LineageOS
===========

About
-----

This is my modified verison of LineageOS, The idea of the mod to deliver what most people want AND not breaking Team Lineage's idea of the rom
Here is the feature list as simple as it gets :-
* Replace LAOS's setup wizard with AOSP's setup wizard (Because LAOS'S one forces copy from device)
* Add OMS support
* Add Google Assistant (Gonna give credits to AOSiP for that one)
* Add DUI (Gonna give credits to Dirty unicorns for that one)
* Make a unofficial LAOS Boot Animation (this one is gonna take time) 

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the LineageOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://github.com/vbajs/LOS-MOD_Mainfest.git -b cm-14.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync --force-sync --force-broken

Please see the [LineageOS Wiki](http://wiki.lineageos.org/) for building instructions.
